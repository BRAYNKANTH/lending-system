// fonts.googleapis.com/fonts.gstatic.com during compilation to download
// and subset the font — when Google's fonts CDN had a transient hiccup
// (or a build ran from a region with a flaky route to it), the build
// failed outright with an opaque `next/font` TypeError, blocking every
// deployment across every organization on this platform until someone
// happened to retry at the right moment. Vendoring the actual files
// removes that external dependency from the build entirely: these are the
// same variable-font files Google would have served (single file per
// family, covering the whole weight range via next/font/local's `weight`
// range syntax below), just no longer fetched fresh on every build.

// wouldn't show up in the browser tab title or favicon until the next
// deploy, breaking the "no redeploy needed" point of this whole feature
// (the in-app header/login already update instantly since those are
